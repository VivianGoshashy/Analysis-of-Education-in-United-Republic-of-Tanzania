# Analysis-of-Education-in-United-Republic-of-Tanzania
In this project, I looked into Secondary school enrollment. The main question that I was answering was, are male students more likely to enroll secondary school at a younger age than female? Next, question was, are male more likely to attend school than female? Lastly, Which region has more female to male ratio?

To answer this, I used dataset that describes secondary school enrollment in Tanzania in the year 2019. I obtained this dataset from http://opendata.go.tz/dataset/takwimu-za-shule-za-sekondari-zilizoainishwa-kwa-uandikishaji-umri-na-jinsi. 

I used R Studio to clean, wrangle, and analyze my dataset.

I started to visualize the dataset by looking into secondary school enrollment by age. From the results, it showed that female students are more likely to enroll in school at a younger age than male and male students tend to finish school at an older age than female. 

Further, I looked into the ratio of female to male student enrollment. From this, I plotted Tanzania map to show the ratio in different regions. From the results, it shows that there are more students enrolled in schools located in central, southern, and eastern part of Tanzania with higher number of female students enrolled in those schools.
